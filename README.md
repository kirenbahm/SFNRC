# SFNRC

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/troyhill/SFNRC.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/troyhill/SFNRC)


## Install the package

Install the SFNRC R package from GitHub using the following commands in the R console:

```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("troyhill/SFNRC", build_vignettes = TRUE)

library(SFNRC)
```

The package comes with an introductory vignette showing some capabilities and usgae examples:

```r
vignette("DataForEver")
```



## Troubleshooting installation

On some systems an initial call to library(SFNRC) generates the following error message: "Error: package ‘gstat’ could not be loaded"

This can be resolved by restarting R, removing the packages "gstat", "sp", and "maps", and reinstalling gstat with argument "dependencies = TRUE":

```r
remove.packages(c("gstat", "sp", "maps"))
install.packages("gstat", dependencies = TRUE)

library(SFNRC)
```
