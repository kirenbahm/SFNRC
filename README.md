[![CRAN_Status_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/SFNRC)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=SFNRC) 

The `SFNRC` R package supports integration and analysis of water quality and hydrology data in south Florida. The package is optimized for use on linux operating systems connected to the South Florida Natural Resources Center's intranet, conditions that provides command-line access to internal databases.


## Install the package

Install the SFNRC R package from GitHub using the following commands in the R console:

```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("troyhill/SFNRC", build_vignettes = TRUE)

library(SFNRC)
```

The linux version of the package comes with an introductory vignette showing some capabilities and usage examples:

```r
vignette("DataForEver")
```

Users of non-linux systems can view a pdf of the vignette [here](https://github.com/troyhill/SFNRC/blob/master/vignettes/DataForEver.pdf), although the DataForEver APIs only work on linux operating systems.
